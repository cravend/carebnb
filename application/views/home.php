            <h2>About carebnb</h2>
            <p><b>Carebnb</b> was founded as a way for us to help people that needed it most. Across the nation, over 640,000 LGBT youths experience homelessness on a yearly basis. Additionally, over 196,467 couldn’t find safe housing after leaving an abusive
              relationship. Our goal is to provide a verified, safe, secure, and private place for those people. </p>

            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>We created carebnb in 2018 at CincyHacks, Cincinnati’s original high school hackathon. We originally decided to make a platform designed to help LGBT youth find permanent housing. However, we then decided to shift our focus to the people who
              need help most &mdash; those who were unexpectedly forced to leave home. We also decided to expand and include anyone who needs help, including people leaving abusive relationships.</p>
